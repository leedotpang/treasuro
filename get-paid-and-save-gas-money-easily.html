        With the rise of gas prices, it can be a challenge trying to save every ounce of gas by slowing down, closing the windows, and limiting use of features like A.C. which is a necessity in hot climates! Fortunately, here are two easy solutions to help you save on gas like a pro.
      </p>
      <h2>Use the GetUpside App</h2>
      <p>
        The GetUpside app is currently a lot like cash back rebate for gas! GetUpside partners with local businesses (gas stations, grocery stores, and restaurants nearby) who want to win you over with great deals you'll never get anywhere else. All you need is your phone and your receipt. There’s no limit on how much you can earn, even with other coupons, discounts, and loyalty programs! It's like getting paid for purchasing what you already purchase.
      </p>
      <img src="IMG_0502.png" alt="GetUpside example" class="gasexample_1">
      <p style="padding-top: 1.5rem";>
        The real power in this is through the referrals you can get onto the app. When you share your referral code with a new user, you each get a bonus the first time they get gas. Note: Your referee must spend a min of $10 on their first gas purchase in order for you to receive your bonus. <span style="font-weight: 700">You also get a bonus for every gallon of gas they buy in the future, and a bonus every time one of their referrals gets gas!</span> Use this <a href="https://upside.app.link/XZWZY">link</a> to unlock big savings and get started!
      </p>
      <h2>Take Advantage of Wholesale Gas</h2>
      <p> Brands like Costco and BJ's offer competitive prices compared to local gas stations. As a matter of fact, the GasBuddy 2016 ‘100 U.S. Best Value Brands’ price survey shows BJ’s is at least 10.88¢ per gallon cheaper than the average competitor price saving members about $55 a year! Even though membership costs only $55 a year and you earn other savings when making in-club purchases, I got you with the insider deal. Sign up for a <a href="https://tellyourfriendsrewards.com/r/hrw70">BJ's membership here</a> and get $25 back!</p>
      <h2>The Combo</h2>
      <p>
        The best ideal situation is if you find a gas station on GetUpside whom's base gas price is equal to or cheaper than wholesale price. Then any rebate cashback on top will be even further savings you can get! For example, you can use the BJ's app to find out what the gas price is for the club you select.
      </p>

      <p style="padding-top: 1.5rem";>
        Then find a gas station, perhaps on in your route, that has the gas price equal to or cheaper than the BJ's price.
      </p>

      <p style="padding-top: 1.5rem";>
        Voila! You just scored bigger savings beating the rise of gas prices. Great job!
